# Grading-Assistant
An experimental approach to enhance assistance in short text answer assessment through the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)

Grading Assistant is a web application that uses the power of ChatGPT's API to automatically rank student answers based on the depth of understanding, correctness, and quality.

Follow these steps to get started with Grading Assistant:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
```shell

```

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access Grading Assistant.




The Manual Ranking Approach is a method that involves manually ranking student responses using LLMs such as ChatGPT and Bing. This approach allows for a more nuanced evaluation of student answers and provides valuable insights into the performance of these models. The project includes datasets for reference and a Jupyter Notebook for visualizing distributions and calculating RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and Pearson Correlation metrics.
